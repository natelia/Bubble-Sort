# Bubble Sort in Ruby
A simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Ruby. Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Key Features
1. **Bubble Sort Implementation**:
The bubble_sort method takes an array as input and sorts it using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
The method iterates through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Ruby installed on your machine.
Clone this repository or copy the code into a file named `bubble_sort.rb`.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `bubble_sort.rb`.
Run the script by executing ruby `bubble_sort.rb`.
